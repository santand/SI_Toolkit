ALMll_Estimation_isotropic_noise.f90 : This code calculates the ALMll for an isotropic noise field. Input is a map with isotropic noise added to it. It will just do the first order estimation of the matrix inversion. 

beta_esstimation.f90 - Only for estimating beta without any noise. (Only one fl)

beta_esstimation_with_noise.f90 - Only for estimating beta with noise. (Only one fl)
